			"name": "Winston",
			"age": "1",
			"bio": "I want an adult only home without any visiting children due to my lack in confidence that makes me react when I feel uneasy and insecure and also someone who will respect that I guard my items such as my bed and food."

			"name": "Harvey",
			"age": "3",
			"bio": "The world seems very large and unsure for me! A nice quiet home for me to settle into would be great and with a patient owner who will help build my confidence and sociability around new people and other animals. I am getting there but things are a little daunting still. "

			"name": "Lana",
			"age": "2",
			"bio": "I am a very clever girl and enjoy learning new things. I have already been told I have a great recall and would love someone to continue this training with me- preferably in a secure area. I will need to stay on lead whilst walking, just in case I get a bit worried by something."

			"name": "Chief",
			"age": "8",
			"bio": " I am a superstar here at the Centre, and love greeting new people with my big smile and waggy tail!  I have been keeping the reception staff company in the afternoons, helping them to meet and greet new people visiting the centre. However it's a tough job so when I'm not doing that,  I am snoozing the time away on my lovely warm bed or giving cuddles to all of the staff. "

			"name": "Lassie",
			"age": "12",
			"bio": "I adore my tennis balls and footballs so someone with a love of playing and training would be ideal, along with regular daily walks. I also enjoy a good doggy puzzle or interactive game!"

			"name": "Lennie",
			"age": "1",
			"bio": "I am a bit of a clown and will definitely keep you entertained, I am still a big puppy so would be too boisterous and bouncy to live with children, therefore an adult only home is what I am looking for. I adore attention, am very affectionate and will be very loyal to my new owner(s)."

			"name": "Shia",
			"age": "5",
			"bio": " Iâ€™m a friendly boy so I just love meeting new dogs only trouble is I can get a bit excited and jump all over them so I do need to continue learning about doggy etiquette. I can be a little more nervous when meeting humans, so do need time and patience to help with my confidence building."
