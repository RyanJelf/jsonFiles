                    The most important way that we ensure that the Chimpanzees are looked after is through their diet, here at Jems we ensure that our Chimpanzees receive a very varied and fresh diet including apples, carrots, oranges, cabbages and of course bananas. 
                    When it comes to maintaining their health we have specialist zoo keepers who have trained our Chimpanzees to put their hands through the bars in their housings in order for us to be able to administer any treatments which should make the process less traumatic."
